# -------------------------------------------
# User Manual: Correlation Matrix Generator
# -------------------------------------------
#
# Overview:
# This script calculates the correlation matrix for variables within an Excel sheet and saves it as a new Excel file.
# It is designed to test and analyze relationships between variables in a given dataset.
#
# How to Use:
# 1. Run the script.
# 2. A file dialog will open â€” select the Excel file you want to analyze (.xlsx only).
# 3. The script will read data from the "Sheet1" sheet.
# 4. The first column is excluded from the correlation analysis (assumed to be non-numeric or an identifier).
# 5. Another dialog will prompt you to save the output Excel file.
# 6. A confirmation message will appear after saving.
#
# Important Notes:
# - Sheet Name: Data must be in a sheet named "Sheet1". Modify 'sheet_name' if needed.
# - Supported Files: Only `.xlsx` format is supported.
# - Column Exclusion: The first column is excluded by default for correlation calculation.
#
# Error Handling:
# - Ensure files are not open or locked by another application during processing.
# - Check for correct file selection and save paths.

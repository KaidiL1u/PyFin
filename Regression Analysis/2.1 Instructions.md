📊 Correlation Matrix Generator — Instructions

Overview

This script calculates the correlation matrix for variables within an Excel sheet and saves the results into a new Excel file.It helps analyze relationships between multiple variables in your dataset.

🚀 How to Use

Run the Script💾 Simply run the Python script.

Select an Excel File📂 A file dialog will open. Select the .xlsx file you want to analyze.

Sheet Handling📄 The script reads data from the "Sheet1" sheet by default.

⚙️ (If your data is in a different sheet, modify the sheet_name in the script.)

Data Preparation➡️ The script excludes the first column from the analysis, assuming it contains non-numeric identifiers (like "Year", "ID", etc.).Only the remaining columns are used for correlation calculation.

Save the Correlation Matrix📀 After processing, another dialog will ask you where to save the output Excel file.

Confirmation✅ A pop-up message will confirm successful saving of the correlation matrix.

📋 Important Notes

Sheet Name:Make sure your dataset is in a sheet named "Sheet1".(Otherwise, edit the script to specify your sheet name.)

Supported Files:Only .xlsx format is supported.(Old .xls or other formats are not accepted.)

Column Exclusion:The first column is excluded by default from correlation analysis.Ensure this fits your dataset structure.

File Locks:Ensure your Excel file is closed before running the script to avoid file access errors.

⚠️ Error Handling

If no file is selected or saved, the script exits gracefully without crashing.

If an error occurs (wrong sheet, bad file, locked file), a pop-up error message will explain what went wrong.

Example Workflow

Run script → Pick data file → Correlation is computed → Pick save location → Done ✅

🛠️ Future Improvements (Optional)

Allow users to select which sheet to analyze.

Add option to exclude multiple identifier columns.

Support .csv or .xls formats.

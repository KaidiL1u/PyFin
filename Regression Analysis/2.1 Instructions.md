# 📊 Correlation Matrix Generator — Instructions for using "2. Correlation Matrix.py"

## Overview
This script calculates the **correlation matrix** for variables within an Excel sheet and saves the results into a new Excel file.  
It helps **analyze relationships** between multiple variables in your dataset.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Run the Script**  
   💻 Simply run the Python script.

2. **Select an Excel File**  
   📂 A file dialog will open. Select the `.xlsx` file you want to analyze.

3. **Sheet Handling**  
   📄 The script reads data from the **"Sheet1"** sheet by default.  
   > ⚙️ *(If your data is in a different sheet, modify the `sheet_name` in the script.)*

4. **Data Preparation**  
   ➡️ The script **excludes the first column** from the analysis, assuming it contains non-numeric identifiers (like "Year", "ID", etc.).  
   Only the remaining columns are used for correlation calculation.

5. **Save the Correlation Matrix**  
   💾 After processing, another dialog will ask you where to **save the output** Excel file.

6. **Confirmation**  
   ✅ A pop-up message will confirm successful saving of the correlation matrix.

## 📋 Important Notes

- **Sheet Name**:  
  Make sure your dataset is in a sheet named **"Sheet1"**.  
  *(Otherwise, edit the script to specify your sheet name.)*

- **Supported Files**:  
  Only `.xlsx` format is supported.  
  *(Old `.xls` or other formats are not accepted.)*

- **Column Exclusion**:  
  The **first column** is excluded by default from correlation analysis.  
  Ensure this fits your dataset structure.

- **File Locks**:  
  Ensure your Excel file is **closed** before running the script to avoid file access errors.

---

## ⚠️ Error Handling

- If no file is selected or saved, the script exits gracefully without crashing.
- If an error occurs (wrong sheet, bad file, locked file), a **pop-up error message** will explain what went wrong.

## Example Workflow

```
Run script → Pick data file → Correlation is computed → Pick save location → Done ✅
```

🚀 How to Use
Run the Script
🖥️ Simply run the Python script.

Select an Excel File
📂 A file dialog will open. Select the .xlsx file you want to analyze.

Sheet Handling
📄 The script reads data from the "Sheet1" sheet by default.

⚙️ (If your data is in a different sheet, modify the sheet_name in the script.)

Data Preparation
➡️ The script excludes the first column from the analysis, assuming it contains non-numeric identifiers (like "Year", "ID", etc.).
Only the remaining columns are used for correlation calculation.

Save the Correlation Matrix
💾 After processing, another dialog will ask you where to save the output Excel file.

Confirmation
✅ A pop-up message will confirm successful saving of the correlation matrix.

📋 Important Notes
Sheet Name:
Make sure your dataset is in a sheet named "Sheet1".
(Otherwise, edit the script to specify your sheet name.)

Supported Files:
Only .xlsx format is supported.
(Old .xls or other formats are not accepted.)

Column Exclusion:
The first column is excluded by default from correlation analysis.
Ensure this fits your dataset structure.

File Locks:
Ensure your Excel file is closed before running the script to avoid file access errors.

⚠️ Error Handling
If no file is selected or saved, the script exits gracefully without crashing.

If an error occurs (wrong sheet, bad file, locked file), a pop-up error message will explain what went wrong.
